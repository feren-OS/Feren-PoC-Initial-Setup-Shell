# Feren-PoC-Initial-Setup-Shell
A proof-of-concept Initial Setup Screen Shell using Plasma (SDDM only)

<h2>What exactly is this for?</h2>
Simply put, it's a Proof-of-concept Plasma Shell for running an Initial Config screen like GNOME's Initial Config, but without GNOME, obviously. It could come in useful for OEM Setup, and also if you removed Ubiquity and then made the OS treat every install as an 'OEM Install' ala Pop!_OS and such...

<h2>Why?</h2>
Well, I thought that any distribution development teams using a Plasma DE in their distributions might want to make use of an Initial Setup screen if it existed.

<h2>Is it complete?</h2>
No. The reason it's incomplete is because it completely lacks the Initial Setup window itself. This is, for now, literally just for building the Plasma Shell to contain a Initial Setup window that is then made by someone else. I would honestly try to make a window for it myself, but I don't know if I would ever be able to make it properly translatable from English by myself.

<h2>Outside of that, is there any other known issues?</h2>
Well, besides the fact some things won't work out of the box due to being designed for Feren OS 'KDE Experimental', it could be flawed in parts, security-wise (e.g.: The fact the user is given 'sudo'/Administrator), but also it has a HUGE NEED on SDDM in its current form, and also on Plasma being installed (obviously).

<h2>Screenshot?</h2>
I'll add a screenshot a little bit later, watch this space...
